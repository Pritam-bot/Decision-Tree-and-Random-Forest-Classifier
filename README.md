# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-Classifier
A very small practice of DecisionTree and RandomForest classifier on Balance Scale dataset.

This dataset has 624 rows and 5 colomns.

This data sets consists numerical and categorical data.

I have used two very common classifier algorithms to make model and check performance and check accuracy score.

Thanks
